My PhD research was focused on the Bayesian formulation of PDE-based models with an aim towards physics-informed machine learning. I have also worked on kernel-based methods for inference of complex models.\n\nPresent StatusExperienceEducationInterestsLanguagesCountries\n\n\n💻 Quantitative Researcher | Bayforest Technologies | September 2023 - Present\n🏠 Based in London\n\n\n💻 AI Research Intern | Arabesque AI | August 2021 - November 2021\n📖 Mathematics Tutor | Keystone Tutors | December 2019 - September 2023\n📖 Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) | Imperial College London | October 2019 - September 2023\n\n\n🎓 PhD in Mathematics | Imperial College London | October 2019 - September 2023\n🎓 MSc in Statistics | Imperial College London | September 2018 - September 2019\n🎓 BA in Mathematics | University of Cambridge | October 2015 - June 2018\n\n\n💻 Programming | Nix | Python | Julia | R\n📚 Mathematics | Bayesian Statistics | Physics-informed ML | Kernel-based methods\n\n\n💬 English (native) | Greek (conversational)\n\n\n🌐 UK (Current; ≈8 years) | Cyprus (≈11 years) | USA (≈10 years)\n\n\n\n Download my CV"
