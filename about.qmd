I'm a Climate Hazard Modeller on the Tropical Cyclone team at [Moody's RMS](https://www.rms.com/).

Previously, I worked as a Quantitative Researcher at [Bayforest Technologies](https://bayforest.ai/).

Before that I completed my PhD in Mathematics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) under the joint supervision of [Dr Andrew Duncan](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~aduncan/) and [Dr Jon Cockayne](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5z6tk6/doctor-jon-cockayne). My PhD research was focused on the Bayesian formulation of PDE-based models with an aim towards physics-informed machine learning. I have also worked on kernel-based methods for inference of complex models.
